# Enterprise RAG Prototype

An enterprise-focused **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) proof-of-concept** designed to evaluate document retrieval, context grounding, and LLM-based question answering in internal knowledge systems.

This repository represents a **sanitized public version** of an internal RAG prototype. Proprietary data, credentials, and organization-specific configurations have been removed.

---

## Overview

Many organizations experiment with RAG pipelines before deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in production environments.  
This project explores a **modular RAG architecture** that enables reliable, context-aware responses over internal documents while minimizing hallucinations.

The focus is on **system design and retrieval logic**, rather than model fine-tuning.

---

## Why This Matters in Industry

- Enterprises require **grounded LLM outputs** when working with internal or sensitive documents.
- RAG has become the **standard architecture** for safe and scalable LLM adoption.
- Demonstrates hands-on experience with **LLM system design**, not just API usage.
- Relevant to enterprise AI, platform engineering, and applied ML teams.
## Key Features

- Modular RAG pipeline design
- Document chunking and embedding-based retrieval
- Context-aware LLM responses
- Easy to extend with different vector stores or LLM providers
- Designed as a **POC / prototype**, not a production system

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Embedding Models  
- Vector Similarity Search  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

---

## Intended Use

This project is intended for:
- Learning and experimentation with RAG architectures
- Internal AI POCs and evaluations
- Understanding enterprise-ready LLM workflows

It is **not intended for direct production use** without additional security, evaluation, and scaling layers.

## Notes on Data & Security

- All proprietary datasets and credentials have been removed.
- Sample or placeholder data is used where required.
- The focus is strictly on **architecture and pipeline logic**.
